    <string name="reflect_text1"><font fgcolor='#00FFFF'>Eric Smith</font> \n<font fgcolor='#00FFFF'>C196 - Mobile Application Development</font>\n\n
        1. <sup>1</sup><p>Mobile application development is the process of creating software applications that run on a mobile device, and a typical mobile application utilizes a network connection to work with remote computing resources. The mobile development process involves creating installable software bundles (code, binaries, assets, etc.), implementing backend services such as data access with an API, and testing the application on target devices.</p>\n\n
<p>Native mobile applications are written in the programming language and frameworks provided by the platform owner and running directly on the operating system of the device such as iOS and Android. My mobile application development project is a native application written in Java in the Android Studio IDE (Integrated Development Environment). When considering building my application and the architecture I would use, the most important part which weighted my decision was knowing what platform and version my application would be deploying to. With each different platform and version comes new capabilities to learn and the type of application brings limitations on the audience I intend to reach. The architecture of the application must also be functional and understanding enough to reduce confusion for new developers working on the application in the future. This will consist of how the user interprets the application through the user interface (UI) to accessibility and convenience. This includes how long it takes the user to find what they are looking for, as well as, are all functions
    in place for the user to complete all the applications functions. When creating this application I implemented these specifics into my architecture components.</p>\n\n
        <blockquote> 1a.	This application has a minimum SDK version of 21 and the Target SDK Version is Android 9.0 (Pie - API 28) and a build cradle version of 3.6.1.</blockquote>\n\n
<p>2. There were many challenges that I faced during the development of this mobile application. These challenges were necessary for me to not just complete the app but to also become a better mobile developer. The long days and nights were just a building block into imperative experience that I had to gain in order to get better at coding the application. For this application I migrated to Android X and used the
    following architecture components:</p>\n\n
        <blockquote>A.	Room Persistence Library, which was the database I used for saving data. Getting acquainted with Room was a challenge in itself because I have never used it before, but when I got familiar with this library, organizing my project became easier and more maintainable. The key factor that took place in my decision to use Room as opposed to SQLite was database access with or without an internet connection and the powerful and convenient use of Room’s annotations.</blockquote>\n\n
        <blockquote>B.	The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way (Android Developers, Guides, Architecture Components). I chose to use the ViewModel class because from the start I knew that managing my data between activities and fragments was crucial to the application’s functionality. This was and still is a learning process because of the implementation of data binding which I did not incorporate into my project. I felt that the Data Binding Library was unnecessary for this application, but because I did implement the ViewModel class I can always go back to my application to integrate this into my application for more functionality between classes.</blockquote>\n\n
        <p>3. The challenges that I faced throughout this application’s development lifecycle were a matter of focus. There were times in the beginning of development where I had to do my research and didn’t even get a chance to open Android Studio. There was no need to. I had to grasp concepts to include ViewModel lifecycles and its implementation as well as Room and its implementation. To overcome the challenges properly I had to organize my learning and research how to properly structure my application in Android Studio and more importantly the structure of my architecture components.</p>\n\n
    <p>4. What would I do differently if I could do the project again? For one, I believe that my project was successful in most attempts but I do believe that I could have went a step further with the user interface and functionality. In the modern era of mobile development there are more and more user accessible features that attract the user. I would have liked to implement these types of features in my own way or even create something of my own. The decision I had to make on this situation was based on time and usability. Second, I believe that the project structure of my application could have been a lot better in regards to encapsulation. This is a constant learning curve that I am getting better at and for the most part, with the more I research and learn this will become second nature.</p>\n\n
       <p>5. <sup>2</sup>The Android Emulator simulates Android devices on your computer so that you can test your application on a variety of devices and Android API levels without needing to have the physical device. The emulator provides almost all of the capabilities of a real Android device. You can simulate incoming phone calls and text messages, specify the location of the device, simulate different network speeds, simulate rotation and other hardware sensors, access the Google Play Store, and much more. Testing your app on the emulator is in some ways faster and easier than doing so on a physical device. For example, you can transfer data faster to the emulator than to a device connected over USB. The emulator comes with predefined configurations for various Android phone, tablet, Wear OS, and Android TV devices.</p>\n\n
        <b>Pros:</b>\n<p>Using an emulator in Android Studio is the perfect tool for making sure your applications UI presents the same way on all devices. I used the emulator mainly for creating my UI and making sure that the screen representation was correct for all devices.</p>\n\n
        <b>Cons:</b>\n<p>It is sometimes tedious and frustrating correcting the screen representation using the emulator because of the views and how I wanted them incorporated inside my application. This is a beneficial yet time consuming problem that I faced due to XML layout behavior. The most important con that I faced in regards to this is the amount of memory it takes to run the emulator as opposed to a physical device. A physical device is much faster and uses a lot less memory when I profiled the project.</p>\n\n
